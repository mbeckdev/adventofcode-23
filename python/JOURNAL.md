## Puzzle 1
Puzzle made me figure out how to open a file, search for numbers, add things together, add things together by line in the text file, lookup words of numbers and turn them into ints, adding integers as strings, then adding that string as an integer, loop by line, optional-reverse a string and search from the back side, use print statements

So yea, that string.strip() would have saved me from doing char.isspace() I even had it originally and commented it out. noooooo.

Also figured out how to open text files in python. Also installed git and vscode and extensions Python and Code Runner

All you have to do is click in .py file, then CTRL-S  then CTRL-ALT-N  -- and it runs below in the output window, then scroll down like crazy because I was printing so many things just for the test input lol.

Yea, Haven't done much python at this point, keep looking up how to do some syntax.

Kept all the comments in there. Sure it's ugly code, but who's ever going to see this haha.
